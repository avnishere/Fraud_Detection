# Fraud_Detection
Online Fraud Detection with masked Data

# One of the Top Acheiving algorithm in the open competition. 
The project is part of an open challenge from Novartis at Hackerearth 2020.
The goal is to detect likely fradulently activity on network servers relying on netwrok state for past instances of fraud.

Masked features are presented without any prior information. 

# Steps

1. Exploratory Data Analysis leading to a baseline estimator.
2. Spot checks to choose a final model.
3. Stratified k-fold cross validation to evaluate the model.
4. Hyperparameter Optimization
5. Results.


Estimators: Random Forest, XGBoost
Validation: Startified K-fold 
Hyperparameter Optimization: Grid Search CV

Platform: Jupyter Notebook, Python 3.7


Repository:  Dataset and a single jupyter file.
